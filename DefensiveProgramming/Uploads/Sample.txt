Defensive programming is a software development practice where developers actively anticipate and guard against potential errors by implementing checks and validations at various stages of code execution, assuming that input data may be invalid or unexpected. This proactive approach aims to create robust systems that can gracefully handle errors, providing informative feedback to the user and preventing crashes or unexpected behavior, even when faced with faulty input or unusual conditions.
